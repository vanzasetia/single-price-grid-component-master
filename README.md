## The Story When Doing This Challenge

I have to use
[Color Picker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gmikhail.colorpicker)
and scan the design images to get the color.

I use my black color which is `rgba(17, 17, 17, 0.2)` for the `box-shadow`.

I added some **special hover effect** for the **Sign Up** button and
my attribution links.

## What I Learned

- I learned new link hover technique, by using `transform: scaleX()`.
- Using `aria-label` on link to describe more detail about what is the
  purpose of the link.

## Built With

This project is created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Sass**. I
also use CSS Grid to span the first row into two columns.
