## The Story When Doing This Challenge
I will start with the `style-guide.md` file. This file doesn't contain the exact color for the `why-us` section. So, I have to use [Color Picker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gmikhail.colorpicker) and scan the design images to get the color.

I also have no idea what is the color fpr the box shadow of the buttons. I tried the card box shadow color which is *Grayish Blue: hsl(218, 22%, 67%)*, it's not the same.

## What I Learned


## Built With
This project is created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Sass**. I also use CSS Grid to span the first row into two columns.
